# Autism Detection Intelligence

#### The project is an Intelligence system that can be used to automate diagnosis of Autism. 

#### Automation is the creation and application of technologies to produce and deliver goods and services with minimal human intervention. Automation has been booming in every field, from Industrial, Home automation,it has also been emerging in medical diagnosis. Hence we believe Automation of medical diagnosis is the new normal.

#### Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviours, speech and nonverbal communication. There are no proper medical tests to diagnose Autism. The doctor has to monitor the patient over a period of time, monitoring their behaviour to conclude.

#### This system aids parent/guardian to diagnose their children, with the help of the information provided by them.

### The Detection system has 4 modules

#### Module 1 - Image classification
##### This module classifies the patient based on an image of the patient fed into the system. The result of this module is then carry forward to the next module to achieve hisher accuracy.
      
#### Module 2 - Predictive Analysis
##### In this module the parent/guardian of the patient are asked a set of questions to answer. The questions are related to the behaviour of the patient. This module uses the answer to those question to make the classification.
       
#### Module 3 - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
#####  In this module the parent/guardian of the patient gives a more detailed description of the patient's behaviour. This description is then tokensied and is used to make classification.
      
#### Module 4 - BERT
 ##### This module acts as an bridge between the Intelligence system and the parent/guardian. The parent/guardian can post any queries related to Autism or ASD and the system provides answers to those queries.
